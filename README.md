# iBuddy (PackHacks 2019)

## Video Demo Link
- [Demo Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1Jrb0NLTFacsE9MPR5eai-qg9Sr-qf8/view?usp=sharing)   (Notice- Demo recorded during the Hack-a-thon. Misses some points but gives a quick intro and working of the system.)

## What it does

The application is divided into two parts.
1. Image analysis using tactile interface
2. Gesture controlled directional image analysis

## Workflow

- A user can interact with iBuddy using three buttons, Red, Green, and Yellow.
- The screen preview camera view and also shows the output of the analysis##### Use cases of buttons
- **Yellow Button**: Click a picture of the camera view
- **Red Button**: Answer No
- **Green Button**: Answer Yes

#### Tactile Interface for human face analysis

- User clicks a picture of image with a human face, using Yellow Button.
- The image is being sent to Azure Face API and we get the overall analysis in the returned json.
- User can listen to overall description of the image, and also see on the screen.
- iBuddy will then ask the user if he/she wants to know the emotion detected in the image.
- User can answer Yes/No using Green & Red Button.
- iBuddy will prompt the response accordingly.

#### Tactile Interface for OCR

- User clicks a picture of image with using Yellow Button.
- The image is being sent to Azure Face API and we get the overall analysis in the returned json.
- User can listen to overall description of the image, and also see on the screen.
- iBuddy will then ask the user if he/she wants to know the text recognised in the image.
- User can answer Yes/No using Green & Red Button.
- iBuddy will prompt the response accordingly.

```

#### Gesture Recognition

- The user can point to any of the four parts of the image and make a small circle with a finger pointed in that direction.
- Leap detects the gesture and iBuddy crops the image in that part 
- That part of the image is sent for analysis and appropriate results are returned.

- Because this is a geture controlled system, the system will give you information according to the part of te picture that you circle.
  
## How we built it

#### Technologies used
- Python 
- Leap Motion
- Raspberry-pi
- Azure
- Natural Language Processing
